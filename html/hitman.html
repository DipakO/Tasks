		<p>Well the times are changing, with the introduction of shorter formats players have adapted to the faster form of the game and it certainly shows 
		the increase in individual scores. Since t20 was introduced all double hundred individual scores have taken place after that.
		One player, in particular, Rohit Sharma has three double tons to his name. 
		Master Blaster Sachin Tendulkar was the first man to achieve this achievement in ODIs when he remained not out and
		capped fine innings of a double hundred against the Proteas. KreedOn brings you the complete Rohit Sharma double century list & all the
		ODI double centuries.
		<p>ROHIT SHARMA VS SRILANKA: – The mammoth 264 run innings by the Hitman should be called the mother of all hundreds,
		which is the world record for the highest individual score in ODI Cricket. Rohit’s 264 comes against the Sri Lankan side 
		who were not formidable they once were. This time around Rohit made up for the failure when he fell 10 runs short of the then-record held
		by Virender Sehwag — 219 against the west indies.</p><br/>
