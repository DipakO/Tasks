	    <h1> Bairstow, Root and Stokes back in action as England look to avenge T20I series loss</h1>
		<p>
			If the three T20Is were any indication, the ODI series promises to be a thrill-a-minute ride.
			England have built a reputation of going hard from the get-go in both white-ball formats, and India, who have traditionally been known to build their 
			innings 
			methodically before going big in the death overs, also took the all-out aggressive route in the T20I series.
			Whether or not they continue with this approach in the ODIs remains to be seen, but conditions should assist quick run-getting,
			with surfaces at The Oval usually among the flatter ones in England.
		</p>

		<p>
			Both sides head into the series on the back of excellent ODI track records.
			England have lost just one of their last 10 ODIs and are fresh from amassing the highest ODI total in history against Netherlands.
			India, meanwhile, have won six of their last 10 games in the format, which includes a 3-0 sweep of West Indies at home earlier this year.</p>
